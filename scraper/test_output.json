ThinkÂ <code>npm install</code>Â for mechanical engineers - we're building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as software.</p><h3><strong>How we actually work</strong></h3><p>Weâre a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Our team members are distributed around the globe. While most of our product and engineering talent is located in Europe and Israel, youâll also work with people from the US and Asia. Most of our work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our success.</p><p><strong>High trust, low bullshit:</strong>Â We don't count hours or peek over your shoulder on Slack. We trust you to get your work done and tell us when something's wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If that sounds exciting, keep reading.)</p><p><strong>Question everything:</strong>Â See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto is âDonât drink the kool-aidâ</p><p><strong>No stupid Meetings:</strong>Â One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar will be beautifully, gloriously empty.</p><p><strong>Actually friendly, not corporate friendly:</strong>Â We play games online every week (current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year we fly everyone somewhere beautiful for our offsite (Greece, here we come). We genuinely like hanging out together, which turns out to be way better than forced \"team building exercises.\"</p><p><strong>What we value in engineering:</strong></p><p><strong>Simple &gt; Complicated.</strong>Â Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions are better than complex ones.</p><p><strong>Ship it, then improve it.</strong>Â Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now, iterate forever.</p><p><strong>Product &gt; Engineering.</strong>Â Every line of code should make our users' lives better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to solve real business problems.</p><h3><strong>Financials</strong></h3><p>Jiga is fully funded, cashflow positive, with growing revenue MoM. We're completely transparent about our runway and finances - ask us anything.</p><h3><strong>You'll love it here if</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>You want to actually own things.</strong>Â Not \"ownership\" where you need three approvals to change a button color. Real ownership where you decide what to build, how to build it, and when to ship it.</li><li><strong>You're genuinely full-stack</strong>Â - you're equally happy building a slick UI component or optimizing a database query. There's no task you'd refuse because it's \"not your specialty.\"</li><li><strong>You care about the product, not just the code</strong>. You want to understandÂ <em>why</em>Â we're building something and you'll push back if it doesn't make sense.</li><li><strong>You are motivated to run a marathon</strong>Â and ring the bell with us in 3-4 years from now.</li><li><strong>Bureaucracy makes you want to scream</strong>. Multiple approval layers, process for the sake of process, corporate theatre - if these sound like your nightmare, welcome home.</li><li><strong>You love shipping.</strong>Â Like, you get genuinely excited when you push to production. That \"it's alive!\" feeling never gets old.</li><li><strong>You work fast</strong>Â because you're having fun, not because someone's watching you.</li></ul><h3><strong>This might not be for you if</strong></h3><ul><li>You hate ambiguity. You prefer clear, detailed task assignments and well-defined requirements</li><li>You like having management to check in, review and verify your work multiple times until itâs perfect</li><li>You're looking for a cuddly, 9-5, corporate job where you can coast a bit</li><li>You like the smell of gasoline and motor oil while driving to the office every day (sorry, we are 100% remote)</li><li>You like weeks of architecting over-complicated solutions</li></ul><p>(No judgment if that's what you want - it's just not what we are.)</p><h3><strong>What you need</strong></h3><ul><li>3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end</li><li>Strong at React + Node.js. MongoDB experience is a great plus.</li><li>Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability</li><li>Solid data modeling fundamentals</li><li>Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users)</li><li>Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes</li></ul><h3><strong>What we offer</strong></h3><p>No ping pong tables. No beer kegs. No \"unlimited vacation\" that nobody takes. No ice cream fridge at the office. Oh right, we don't even have an office.</p><p>Here's what we do have:</p><ul><li><strong>A small team where you matter</strong>Â - we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world.</li><li><strong>Zero bureaucracy</strong>Â - we hate process theatre as much as you do</li><li><strong>Real ownership and responsibility</strong>Â - make decisions, ship code, own the outcomes. Have real impact on the product from day 1.</li><li><strong>Complete flexibility</strong>Â - work from anywhere, set your own hours, take time off when you need it (parents and DMs are very welcome)</li><li><strong>Genuinely high trust</strong>Â - we trust you to do great work and be honest when things go sideways</li><li><strong>A team that actually likes each other</strong>Â - international, diverse, genuinely friendly people who enjoy working together</li><li><strong>Generous stock options</strong>Â - weâre looking for partners to run a marathon with us, you will get a life-changing shares when we get to the finish line</li><li><strong>Competitive salary and PTOs</strong>Â - so you can also enjoy, relax and recharge</li><li><strong>Self-development budget</strong>Â for books, courses, conferences, whatever helps you grow</li><li><strong>Annual offsite</strong>Â in beautiful places (greece, here we come!)</li><li><strong>Fast-paced environment</strong>Â with tons of creative freedom</li><li>Hard, interesting problems with aÂ <strong>team that's positioned to win big</strong></li></ul><h3><strong>How to apply:</strong></h3><p>Send us a short blurb about yourself and your favorite ice cream flavor.

GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid â as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry â and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.</p><p>GD has raised over $1B since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1.5 million people in 15 different countries. Weâve also supported large-scale, experimental research that indicates strong recipient impact of our programs.
